# Bwire

I’m a developer who builds real-world systems — mostly full-stack, sometimes Web3, always with intention.

I care about clean architecture, problem-solving, and making things that actually work.  
Currently working on tools that blend usability, performance, and security.

This profile is a collection of what I’ve built, what I’m learning, and what I’m still figuring out.
